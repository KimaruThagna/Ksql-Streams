# Ksql-Streams
Learning stream processing using KSQL on top of Apache Kafka

I will be using this project to demonstrate real time analytics and also anomaly detection.
The use cases covered will be:

1. Anomaly detection- Use data generated from `mock_server_logs.py` in real time to perform anomaly detection. We will be checking for errors within a certain time frame. eg, if number of errors exceed 5 within 1 minute. This mimics the cloudwatch metrics in AWS.

2. Real time analytics for a product shop- Assume a high end online shop sells products and the business is very sensitive to bad ratings. The business would like to detect a bad rating as soon as it happens. This will then allow customer relations team to folow up. We will use KSQL to filter out bad ratings(less than 3 out of 5). We will use data from `mock_ratings.py`

3. Fraud detection using streaming analytics- Use bank transactional data generated by `mock_transactions.py` to provide a stream of transation actions. To detect possible fraud, we will filter out transactions with large withdrawal amounts.(greater than 1000000).

# Concepts
**Stream** Immutable sequence of events of data coming into a Kafka topic. Good for real time granular analysis

**Topic** A structure that represents the current state of data coming into a stream. 
Consider it as the sum total of all events in the stream at a certain point in time. Just like a normal SQL table. Good for aggregate and grouping analysis

# Producer
The producer for this demo is in `common_producer.py`. This will produce transactions logs and rating records for the KSQL Demo.
